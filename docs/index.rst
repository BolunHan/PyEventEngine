PyEventEngine Documentation
============================

High-performance, topic-driven event engine for Python with a Cython-accelerated core and a native Python fallback.

**PyEventEngine** provides fast publish/subscribe event routing by topic with exact and generic wildcard/pattern matching. It features a clean, typed API with automatic fallback when C extensions are unavailable, plus built-in timers, handler statistics, and convenient formatting helpers.
